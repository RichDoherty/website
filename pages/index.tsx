                About Me:
              </h2>
              <p className='text-base text-neutral-900'>
                Nice to meet you! I&#39;m a software engineer who is passionate about learning all things coding related and building things along the way.
                <br />
                <br />
                The first time I was introduced to programming was in a middle school HTML class. I made a fan-site for my favorite football team at the time, the Denver Broncos. The website was not pretty, but I had fun creating it and it made me aware that programming was a thing I could learn.
                <br />
                <br />
                Years after my first foray into HTML, upon entering college, I decided to major in computer science. I took the usual programming courses, data structure & algorithms, object-oriented programming, etc. I even worked on some side projects.
                <br />
                <br />
                At the time, I had started to learn Japanese, so I developed a flashcard app to help me remember the Japanese alphabets. It helped me more than I expected, honestly. I showed the app to some others, and it actually helped them too! That was when I truly discovered my love for programming. I could make things that helped people achieve their goals!
                <br />
                <br />
                Since then, I graduated from Molloy College with honors and I&#39;m looking to start working full-time where I can help a company achieve their goals.
