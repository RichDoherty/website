## Background

I tried to create this project a few years ago and was not able to figure it out.
But recently I decided to give it another shot. I also wanted to try [Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/)
since that framework seems to be getting more and more popular. I am happy to say
I was able to figure it out this time, and I'll show you how I did it.

## What I Used to Make This Site

-   [Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [RosÃ© Pine Theme](https://rosepinetheme.com/)

## First Steps

The first step, as always, is to create the project. In Solidjs, that is done with
the following commands:

```shell
> npx degit solidjs/templates/ts my-app
> cd my-app
> npm i # or yarn or pnpm
> npm run dev # or yarn or pnpm
```

Then, I created the bars that are going to be sorted and added some text and buttons.

For the bars I used Solidjs' "[For](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/flow_for)"
tag to render a bar for each element in the bars array (I'll get to that in the next section):

```tsx {6-14}
<div class={styles.App}>
    <header class={styles.header}>
        <h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
    </header>
    <div id="visualizer" class={styles.visualizer}>
        <For each={bars}>
            {(bar, i) => (
                <div
                    id={"bar" + i().toString()}
                    class={styles.bar}
                    style={`height: ${bar}%;
                width: ${numOfBars()}%;`}
                ></div>
            )}
        </For>
    </div>
</div>
```

I also added the buttons and an input where the user can enter how many bars they
want to appear on the screen:

```tsx {16-34}
<div class={styles.App}>
    <header class={styles.header}>
        <h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
    </header>
    <div id="visualizer" class={styles.visualizer}>
        <For each={bars}>
            {(bar, i) => (
                <div
                    id={"bar" + i().toString()}
                    class={styles.bar}
                    style={`height: ${bar}%;
                width: ${numOfBars()}%;`}
                ></div>
            )}
        </For>
    </div>
    <div class={styles.input}>
        <div id="buttonDiv" class={styles.buttonDiv}>
            <button
                class={styles.resetButton}
                onClick={() => {
                    const val = parseInt(
                        (
                            document.getElementById(
                                "numOfBars"
                            ) as HTMLInputElement
                        ).value
                    );
                    if (val < 10 || val > 100) {
                        return alert("Number must be between 10 and 100.");
                    }
                    setNumOfBars(val);
                    newBarsArray();
                }}
            >
                Reset
            </button>
            <button
                class={styles.sortButton}
                onClick={() => {
                    bubbleAnimation(bubbleSort(bars));
                }}
            >
                Bubble Sort
            </button>
            <button
                class={styles.sortButton}
                onClick={() => {
                    selectionAnimation(selectionSort(bars));
                }}
            >
                Selection Sort
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Signals

According to the [Solidjs tutorial](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/introduction_signals),
"Signals are the cornerstone of reactivity in Solid. They contain values that
change over time; when you change a signal's value, it automatically updates
anything that uses it."

To use it you must first import it:

```tsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";
```

I wanted to use it to determine the number of bars appearing on the screen and I
set it up like this:

```tsx
const [numOfBars, setNumOfBars] = createSignal(50);
```

Inside the brackets are a getter and a setter. `numOfBars` is a function that
returns the current value. It isn't actually the value itself. `setNumOfBars`
is a function that updates the current value.

### Stores

In Solidjs, ["stores"](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/stores_createstore) allow
for [nested reactivity](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/stores_nested_reactivity).
I used this to hold the array of numbers which determine the values of each bar:

```tsx
const [bars, setBars] = createStore([0]);
```

Using a store allows us to update the array and see the changes without having
to replace it with a clone of itself.

I used both of these features in conjucntion to randomize the array when the page
loads and whenever the "reset" button is clicked:

```tsx
const newBarsArray = () => {
    setBars(
        Array.from({ length: numOfBars() }, () =>
            Math.floor(Math.random() * 98 + 1)
        )
    );
};

newBarsArray();
```

```tsx {7}
<button
    class={styles.resetButton}
    onClick={() => {
        const val = parseInt(
            (document.getElementById("numOfBars") as HTMLInputElement).value
        );
        if (val < 10 || val > 100) {
            return alert("Number must be between 10 and 100.");
        }
        setNumOfBars(val);
        newBarsArray();
    }}
>
    Reset
</button>
```

## Animations

Now for the fun part, the animations!

The sorting algorithms I have implemented so far are:

-   [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
-   [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

### Bubble Sort

The first algorithm I decided to implement an animation for is bubble sort. I won't
get into exactly how these algorithms work in this post but here is the code for
it:

```tsx
const bubbleSort = (arr: number[]) => {
    let sortedArr = Array.from(arr);
    let animations = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < sortedArr.length - i - 1; j++) {
            animations.push("compare");
            if (sortedArr[j] > sortedArr[j + 1]) {
                animations.push("first");
                animations.push("swap");
                [sortedArr[j], sortedArr[j + 1]] = [
                    sortedArr[j + 1],
                    sortedArr[j],
                ];
            } else {
                animations.push("second");
            }
            animations.push("reset");
        }
    }
    return animations;
};
```

You probably noticed the animations array since that is not present on a normal
bubble sort function. That array stores the frames for the animation. Each string
that is pushed to the array represents what is happening in the algorithm.

-   "compare": Two items are being compared.
-   "first": The first item's value is greater.
-   "second": The second item's value is greater.
-   "swap": The item's positions are swapped.
-   "reset": The colors of the bars are reset to their original colors.

### Bubble Sort Animations

Next, I used the resulting animations array in another function which makes use
of the commands and actually changes the positions and colors of the bars.

```tsx
const bubbleAnimation = (animations: string[]) => {
    let i = 0;
    let barId = 0;
    let pass = 0;
    const iid = setInterval(() => {
        if (i < animations.length) {
            const bar1 = document.getElementById("bar" + barId.toString());
            const bar2 = document.getElementById(
                "bar" + (barId + 1).toString()
            );
            if (bar1 && bar2 && barId < bars.length - pass - 1) {
                if (animations[i] === "compare") {
                    bar1.style.backgroundColor = "#f6c177";
                    bar2.style.backgroundColor = "#f6c177";
                } else if (animations[i] === "first") {
                    bar1.style.backgroundColor = "#eb6f92";
                } else if (animations[i] === "swap") {
                    setBars(
                        produce((bars) => {
                            [bars[barId], bars[barId + 1]] = [
                                bars[barId + 1],
                                bars[barId],
                            ];
                        })
                    );
                } else if (animations[i] === "second") {
                    bar2.style.backgroundColor = "#eb6f92";
                } else if (animations[i] === "reset") {
                    bar1.style.backgroundColor = "#ebbcba";
                    bar2.style.backgroundColor = "#ebbcba";
                    barId++;
                }
                i++;
            } else {
                pass++;
                barId = 0;
            }
        } else {
            clearInterval(iid);
        }
    }, speed());
};
```

I'll break this function down piece by piece.

First, the variables at the start.

-   animations: The array that results from running the bubbleSort function. It
    contains all the instructions for the animation.
-   i: The current index of the animations array.
-   barId: A number that represents the current bar the function is looking at.
-   pass: This number represents the amount of times the function made it to the end
    of the array of bars.

Next, I set up a `setInterval` function. This repeats the code inside the
interval after a set time. I have it set to `speed()` which I set in this
line:

```tsx
const [speed, setSpeed] = createSignal(200);
```

The speed is in milliseconds so in this case it would be 200 milliseconds.

Then we have these lines of code:

```tsx
const bar1 = document.getElementById("bar" + barId.toString());
const bar2 = document.getElementById("bar" + (barId + 1).toString());
```

Since we need to compare a bar with the one that comes after, we get the first one
using `barId` and the next with `barId + 1`.

Then we get into some ifs and else ifs. For example:

```tsx
if (bar1 && bar2 && barId < bars.length - pass - 1) {
```

For each pass, the function should leave out the bars that are already in the
correct position at the end, so subtracting pass from the length is necessary so
function knows when to reset `barId` to 0.

The next few statements are pretty self explanatory. They check the current element
in the animations array and changes the color based on what step it is, "compare,"
"first," "swap," "second," and "reset."

One thing to clarify is when it is time to swap the bars. `setBars()` can be
used to change the array, but to actually mutate the array without replacing the
current array with a new one, the [produce()](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/stores_mutation)
function must be called inside `setBars()`.

Finally, when `else` is reached, `pass` is incremented and `barId` is
set back to 0.

When the end of the animations array is reached, it is important not to forget to
clear the interval using `clearInterval(iid)`.

And there we have it! The bubble sort animation is complete.

### Selection Sort

I set up selection sort like this:

```tsx
const selectionSort = (arr: number[]) => {
    let sortedArr = Array.from(arr);
    let animations = [];
    let minIndex = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length - 1; i++) {
        minIndex = i;
        for (let j = i + 1; j < sortedArr.length; j++) {
            if (sortedArr[j] < sortedArr[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = j;
            }
            animations.push(minIndex);
        }
        [sortedArr[i], sortedArr[minIndex]] = [
            sortedArr[minIndex],
            sortedArr[i],
        ];
    }
    return animations;
};
```

Similarly to my bubbleSort function, selectionSort is the same as a normal
selection sort but with the animations array. However, instead of pushing a command
like "compare" or "swap," I pushed the minIndex. I tried pushing commands for this
function as well, but there were issues with the bars not swapping properly. Since
the function looks through each element in the array and only swaps elements at the
end of a loop each time, passing the minIndex is sufficient.

### Selection Sort Animations

```tsx
const selectionAnimation = (animations: number[]) => {
    let i = 0;
    let barId = 1;
    let pass = 0;
    let minIndex = 0;
    const iid = setInterval(() => {
        const lastBar = document.getElementById(
            "bar" + (numOfBars() - 1).toString()
        );
        if (i < animations.length) {
            const minBar = document.getElementById("bar" + minIndex.toString());
            const compareBar = document.getElementById(
                "bar" + barId.toString()
            );
            const swapBar = document.getElementById("bar" + pass.toString());
            const prevBar = document.getElementById(
                "bar" + (barId - 1).toString()
            );
            if (minBar && compareBar && barId < bars.length - 1) {
                if (lastBar) {
                    lastBar.style.backgroundColor = "#ebbcba";
                }
                if (swapBar) {
                    swapBar.style.backgroundColor = "#9ccfd8";
                }
                compareBar.style.backgroundColor = "#f6c177";
                minBar.style.backgroundColor = "#31748f";
                if (prevBar && prevBar !== minBar) {
                    prevBar.style.backgroundColor = "#ebbcba";
                }
                if (swapBar && minIndex !== animations[i]) {
                    minBar.style.backgroundColor = "#ebbcba";
                    compareBar.style.backgroundColor = "#31748f";
                    swapBar.style.backgroundColor = "#9ccfd8";
                }
                minIndex = animations[i];
                barId++;
            } else {
                if (compareBar) {
                    compareBar.style.backgroundColor = "#f6c177";
                }
                if (prevBar) {
                    prevBar.style.backgroundColor = "#ebbcba";
                }
                if (minBar) {
                    minBar.style.backgroundColor = "#ebbcba";
                }
                minIndex = animations[i];
                setBars(
                    produce((bars) => {
                        [bars[minIndex], bars[pass]] = [
                            bars[pass],
                            bars[minIndex],
                        ];
                    })
                );
                pass++;
                minIndex = pass;
                barId = 1 + pass;
            }
            i++;
        } else {
            if (lastBar) {
                lastBar.style.backgroundColor = "#ebbcba";
            }
            clearInterval(iid);
        }
    }, speed());
};
```

There are a bunch more bars in this one than in bubble sort. `lastBar` is there to
reset the color of the last bar right before `clearInterval()` is called.
`minBar` is the bar with the minimum value during the current pass. `compareBar`
is the current bar being looked at. `swapBar` is the initial bar in the pass
which will be swapped at the end of the pass. `prevBar` is the bar before `compareBar`.
This is needed to change the color back to pink after it is checked.

This function goes from the first bar to the final bar in the array, changing
colors along the way. When the last bar is reached we go to the else statement
where the `minBar` is swapped with the bar whose index is represented by `pass`.

## Conclusion

I enjoyed making this project and though it was frustrating at times when the
animations wouldn't work properly, it was incredibly satisfying to get it working.
I may come back and update this with other algorithms in the future, but for now
I hope you enjoyed seeing the process and I hope you learned something from this.

Thanks for reading!
